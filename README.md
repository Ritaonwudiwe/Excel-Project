### Project Overview
---
This project aims to provide insight into road accident occurrences in the UK's rural and urban areas between 2000 and 2022. the operations performed include data cleaning, exploration, Consolidation, data analysis using Pivot tables, filtering, sorting, and visualization. to share my findings, I built a dashboard showing the primary KPIs, Secondary KPIs, and number of casualties. I included a filter and slicer panel and established a connection between it and the KPIs for stakeholders to access specific information. By analyzing the various aspects of the road accident data, we seek to identify trends, monitor KPIs, determine the root causes of these accidents, areas, vehicles, and seasons with the most casualties, and make data-driven recommendations to stakeholders.

### Data Source
This dataset was open-source and downloaded from Kaggle. Find the link in the [References](#references) section. It contains 33 Features/columns covering over 1.8 million records. Some of its features include Accidental / Longitude, Accident_Severity, Number_of_Vehicles, Number_of_Casualties, Light_Conditions, Weather_Conditions, Road_Surface_Conditions, Year.

### Tools
- Excel formulas and functions for data cleaning, exploration, Consolidation, data analysis using Pivot tables, filtering, sorting, and visualization

### Data Cleaning
1. Loading and inspecting data
2. Handling missing and inconsistent values in the data
3. Extract the month using the TEXT function `TEXT(col, "mmm")`
4. Extract the years using the TEXT function `TEXT(col, "yyyy")`

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the UK road accident data to answer these key questions:

 - what is the total number of casualties for the year 2021 and 2022
 - What is the number of casualties on each day of the week?
 - What is the importance of Light and Weather conditions in predicting accident severity?
 - what is the percentage of the total casualties based on accident severities?

### Data Analysis

### Results
The analysis results are summarised as follows:
- The urban area has more casualties than the rural area.
- Cars caused more accidents than other vehicles
- There are more accidents in well-lit places than in dark areas
