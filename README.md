# This is an Excel project on Road Accident Data Analysis.
# In the project, I performed operations such as Data Cleaning, Exploration, Consolidation, data analysis using Pivot tables, and visualization.
# I built a dashboard showing the primary KPIs, Secondary KPIs, and number of casualties.
# I included a filter panel and established a connection between it and the KPIs for stakeholders to access specific information.
